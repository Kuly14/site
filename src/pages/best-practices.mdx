# Best Practices in Aiken 

This is a little guide or perhaps list of suggestions to improve the readability of your Aiken code, 
help you write more efficient Aiken code, to introduce Aiken features you might not be aware of,
and to help you avoid common pitfalls. Keep in mind the Aiken compiler is always improving, so I'll 
try to keep this up to date with best practices.

# Creating easy to read Aiken code

## Use the Formatter
First and foremost, USE THE FORMATTER. One it saves time, Two it creates Aiken code in a uniform familiar format
to all Aiken users, and Three if there is an issue let us know. Any issues we can resolve will improve everyones 
experience using Aiken.

## Using Pipe Operators
Another best practice to improve the readability of your Aiken code is to use pipe operators (|>). 
Pipe operators are used to chain functions together in a way that's easy to read and understand. 
Instead of nesting function calls, you can use the pipe operator to pass the result of one function 
as the input to the next. This can make your code cleaner and easier to follow.

For example, consider the following Aiken code without pipe operators:

```aiken
let result = function3(function2(function1(input), other_input))
```

This can be rewritten using pipe operators to improve readability:

```aiken
let result = input 
              |> function1 
              |> function2(other_input) 
              |> function3
```

In the rewritten code, it's clear that the input is first passed to `function1`, then the result is passed to `function2`, 
and finally the result of `function2` is passed to `function3`. This makes the code easier to read and understand. 
By default pipe operators pass the result of the previous operation as the first argument to the next function.
You can change this by using _ like so:


```aiken
let result = input 
              |> function1 
              |> function2(other_input, _) 
              |> function3
```

Now the result of function1 is passed as the second argument to function2.
